echo "Finally, they came upon the $creature, who snarled and said, 'Only those with true courage may take the $magical_object. But first, you must prove your worth.'"

echo "With a deep breath and $emotion in their heart, $hero_name faced the $creature. $hero_name and $companion_name fought bravely, but the creature was relentless.
